This page contains a carousel in the hero section that scrolls through the exact images found on the xbox page. I only created 3 rows of products, as I was under a time constraint for this project (although see as the styles for the product card and sections are the same, I could just copy and paste once I have the images). This project also shows that I still have a lot to learn with bootstrap as well, as I wasn’t able to style checkboxes to be accurate with the Xbox page. I may have been able to accomplish this using bootstrap’s SASS variables, but again, I wanted to limit this project to only css.</p></div>
                  <div class="project-comment col-md-3 m-auto text-center border-light"><p>For this project, The biggest challenge that I saw for this was the two-column layout of the product. Although the only reason this was the case was because I was referring to a previous project where I used a different method to achieve a similar effect. Rather than making two columns and creating a div within that column, I created a div and then moved that div to the right side of the page. This works, however I had to adjust the width of the elements on the left to prevent part of the text from being hidden underneath the new side article. A simpler method would have been to just split the content section into 2 columns-one for the main section content and one for the side article. This is the method that I used for this project, As it saved me time when writing css (and probably conforms to bootstrap best practices better). </p></div>
                  <div class="project-comment col-md-3 m-auto text-center border-light"><p>Overall, this project was not difficult. A lot of the styles on the page were the same for many elements, which meant that I could write styles for one class and apply it to many elements at once. To extend this project, I would use SASS to have a better control over bootstrap’s styles, and change them in a less messy way. Something interesting that I had not done before in this project was pull images directly out of the HTML of a site, rather than copying  to image address or the image itself. Another thing that I would do is properly style the checkboxes to get a more accurate design.
