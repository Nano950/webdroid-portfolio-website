When I was looking over the requirements of the page and what the intended design was supposed to look like, I immediately thought of using the CSS grid to layout all of the content. For the hero section of the page, I decided to size it using vh units, since I wanted it to take up the who viewport, regardless of the width of the screen (technically this does not give the hero section of the page the exact size of the page that the design of the page had, however at the time I thought that the page still looked good at this size, so I went with it). For the testimonial section of the page, I used a flexbox to align each testimonial, and space them evenly apart. </p></div>
                  <div class="project-comment col-md-3 m-auto text-center border-light"><p>There were two big challenges for me in this project, working with the CSS grid, and formatting the content within the grid. At the time I had just recently learned what the CSS grid was, and how to use it to create layouts for a page. Initially creating the desktop layout for the page was relatively ealy, but I had a problem with the way that some of the sections were rendered. This was due to a misuse of the cascading effect of CSS. However, when I moved on to the mobile view of the page, I could not properly reposition the elements on the page. I believe that this was in part due to my grid layout, so to solve this, I created a separate grid ruleset for mobile viewports containing only one column. This solution worked, however, I believe that this is a sub-optimal solution. </p></div>
